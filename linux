Linux Administration
======================
User Management

User Groups Roles Permissions

User -> A human
Group -> A team of humans
Roles -> position
Permissions -> Access to the roles

1. create user
2. create group
3. add user to the group
4. remove user from the group
5. remove user
6. remove group

1. create devops group
2. create gopi user
3. add gopi to devops group
4. remove gopi from devops group
5. remove gopi user

useradd gopi -> creates gopi user
groupadd devops -> creaes devops group

id <user-name>
id gopi
uid=1001(gopi) gid=1001(gopi) groups=1001(gopi)

when you create user in Linux, by default it will create one group with same username

/etc/passwd
gopi:x:1001:1001::/home/gopi:/bin/bash

/etc/group
devops:x:1002:

/etc/shadow -> encrypted password

A user in Linux must have 1 primary group and atleast 1 secondary group

usermod -g <group-name> <user-name> --> adding gopi to devops group
usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name> --> adding gopi to secondary group

passwd <user-name>

/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> SSH configuration

PasswordAuthentication no

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd -t -> checks the syntax of ssh

systemctl restart sshd

gpasswd -d <user-name> <group-name>

id gopi
gopi gopi gopi

files and permissions
=====================
Read    -> 4
Write   -> 2
Execute -> 1

-	rw-			r--		r--
	owner/user	group	others
	u			   g		o
	
chmod g+w 
chmod 744
